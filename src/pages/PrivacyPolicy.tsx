/**
 * PrivacyPolicyPage
 * -----------------
 * Drop-in React component for a /privacy route.
 *
 * Props let you quickly tailor the brand, site URL, and email without editing the copy.
 * Accessibility:
 * - Uses semantic landmarks (<main/section>) and headings (h1..h2).
 * - Mailto links have clear text.
 *
 * Styling:
 * - Uses your Tailwind tokens (text-ink, text-ink-soft, container width helpers).
 * - Keep it minimal so it works even without the typography plugin.
