# SkillBridge

SkillBridge is a React + TypeScript application that guides users through a career analysis journey, highlights skill gaps, and surfaces training resources and high-level labour market insights. It combines a multi-step Analyzer wizard with a persistent Profile hub and an Insight dashboard backed by real-world data.

## Features

- **Career Analyzer Wizard**  
  `Get Info â†’ Abilities â†’ Job Suggestion â†’ Skill Gap â†’ Training` collects role interests, preferred regions, industries, and expertise, then calls backend services to generate recommendations.

- **Smart Job Suggestions**  
  Occupations are ranked via parallel API calls (TanStack Query). Past roles from the Profile are automatically filtered so users only see fresh opportunities.

- **Skill Gap & Training Advice**  
  Missing abilities are captured in Redux, merged into the Profileâ€™s Skill Roadmap, and paired with training courses fetched on demand. Users can prune or update the advice list in place.

- **Insight Dashboard**  
  Displays major group statistics, growth comparisons, and geographic demand on an interactive map. Includes skeleton states, error fallbacks, and an in-app tutorial.

- **Supporting Modules**  
  Feedback form with API integration, Privacy/Terms static pages, glossary search, and reusable Hero/Tutorial components for consistent onboarding.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Create environment variables** (`.env` or `.env.local`)
   ```bash
   VITE_API_BASE=https://your-api-gateway.example.com/
   VITE_SITE_PASSWORD=YourSitePassword
   ```
3. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Build / preview / lint**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   npm run lint
   ```

## Key Design Notes

- Analyzer state is persisted in `analyzerSlice` and hydrated from `location.state` where necessary to survive refreshes or private browsing.
- Job Suggestion filters out roles the user has already listed in the Profile, keeping recommendations fresh.
- Skill Gap results are normalized and merged into the Profileâ€™s Skill Roadmap without overwriting user-added items.
- Insight normalizes API payloads (`safeNumber`, `safeString`) before rendering charts to guard against inconsistent fields.
- UI components emphasise accessibility: skeletons use `aria-busy`, hero imagery is optionally decorative, map/chart sections include textual guidance.
